Super simple usage:

0 - [Optional] Define an environment variable called BASE_DIR which will serve as the starting point of all file trees created by the script. I personally think this is worthwhile, as opposed to inputting this each time via CLI (but as fallback I allowed direct CLI input via user input).

1 - Input name of target you want to create file tree for.

2 - Visit the file tree as specified in the terminal output eg. /<base_directory>/<target_name>
